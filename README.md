## Description
The web application serves as a music cataloguing service, that enables users
to catalogue albums, artists, playlists, and individual songs. Users have the
ability rate their saved music, and the application tracks their individual
rating the given music item (album/artist/song). The application offers search
by album, artist and track. When viewing music items, ordering can be set by
various parameters, such as by release date, popularity, followers, name, etc.
The albums, artists, songs and data about them are retrieved using Spotify
