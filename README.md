## Description
The web application serves as a music cataloguing service, that enables users
to catalogue albums, artists, playlists, and individual songs. Users have the
ability rate their saved music, and the application tracks their individual
rating as well as the overall rating average of all users for the given music
item (album/artist/song). The application offers search and filter options by
various parameters, such as by artist, release date, genre, and rating, etc.
Users can send friend requests to other users. If the request is accepted, both
users will be able to see each other's collections and ratings.
